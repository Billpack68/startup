## Git and GitHub notes

Git is a tool to save older versions of projects and is incredibly useful for coding.
GitHub is a website where I can view those older versions as well as other projects by other people.
Before working on the project, do a `git pull`
Code, test, repeat
When it's working, `git commit` and `git push`
I should push a commit to github at least 10 times for each assignment in this class

## AWS Notes

I don't know much about AWS yet, but I'm sure I'll more as I get further into the course.

## HTML Notes

I hear a lot of programmers make fun of HTML. I'm excited to see if I love it or hate it.
