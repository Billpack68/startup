## Git and GitHub notes

Git is a tool to save older versions of projects and is incredibly useful for coding.
GitHub is a website where I can view those older versions as well as other projects by other people.
Before working on the project, do a `git pull`
Code, test, repeat
When it's working, `git commit` and `git push`
I should push a commit to github at least 10 times for each assignment in this class

## Console and editor notes

Use Git Bash instead of windows powershell (maybe just in general?)
Get familiar with VI and VSCode

## The Internet

All devices have an IP address, and a domain name is a more english way of communicating that information. You can look up any domain name to get the associated IP address.

## AWS Notes

To SSH into my website, `& ssh -i ~/[location of my key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]`
To exit the SSH use `exit`
IP address (elastic): 34.199.202.124
The IP address costs 3$ a month if the server instance is down
The server instance is free for the first 750 hours, but I may need to upgrade it soon
My plan for now is to use the free server instance and leave it running because I'll probably have to upgrade within the month to get a stronger computer
Turning off the instance now means I will for sure pay for the elastic IP and only possibly be able to keep using the free tier server instance in the future

## HTML Notes

I hear a lot of programmers make fun of HTML. I'm excited to see if I love it or hate it.
