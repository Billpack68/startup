# JS Notes

## Basics

- `console.log("text")` to log stuff in the console
- define functions `function name(input1, input2) {}`
- Accepts line and block comments `//` and `/**/`

## Referencing it in html

- Option 1: `<script src="filename.js"></script>`
- Option 2: `<script> /*Just put the JS code here*/ </script>`
- Option 3: define variables in the JS within the HTML `<script> let i = 1; </script>`

## Debugging

- You can go into the console deep stuff and click on source and see the JS and add breakpoints that are triggered upon refresh (super cool)
