      <p>About</p>
      <p>In my apartment, some of the dryers work well and some don't.
         After living there for a few months, I thought I had a pretty good idea of which ones were which. 
         One day, my roommate came home and complained about the dryer not drying his clothes. 
         I made fun of him for not being familiar with the good dryers. 
         A few days later, I went to pick up my dried clothes, only to find out that I had chosen a bad dryer. 
         "If only there were a website where I could review the dryers so that my peers know which ones to avoid" 
         I thought to myself. Then I remembered that I was in a web development class, in which we'd make a website. 
         The website I was working on at the time was pretty goofy, so I decided to throw that idea in the hamper 
         and make something useful instead. Later that same day I was looking at reviews of apartments in the area 
         and noticed that lots of negative reviews mentioned bad washers and dryers. Hopefully this website helps you 
         to avoid the bad washers and dryers.</p>
