# The Silly Websites Website

[My Notes](notes.md)

This project is going to be a website where users can share links to silly websites and vote on their favorite silly websites.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

There are a lot of silly and interesting websites on the web, and sometimes it can be hard to find the one you saw a few years ago, or maybe you've got a few minutes to fill before catching the bus and you want something quick to entertain you. My website will be a link sharing website where users can share links to their favorite silly and interesting websites, and then can vote on the ones submitted by everyone else that they think are the most funny and interesting.
